#Customer Churn Analysis
Overview-
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn data to identify key factors that lead to customer attrition. 
By leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy, the analysis explores demographic, service, and contract-related variables
to uncover patterns in customer behavior. The findings are presented through a series of detailed visualizations and an executive summary with 
actionable recommendations to help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

Key Insights
The analysis identified several critical factors strongly correlated with customer churn:

Contract and Internet Service: Customers on month-to-month contracts are the most likely to churn, accounting for 34.05% of all churned customers.
This rate is significantly higher than for customers with one-year (13.79%) or two-year (2.85%) contracts. A key finding is the particularly high
churn rate among month-to-month customers who use Fiber Optic internet service.

Tenure: The probability of churn is highest among new customers with a short tenure of just one or two months. Customer loyalty tends to increase 
as tenure lengthens, with a noticeable decrease in churn rates for long-term customers.

Payment Method: The payment method a customer chooses is a significant indicator of churn risk. Customers using electronic checks have the highest 
churn rate, with 42.92% of this group churning. Automated payment methods like bank transfers and credit cards are associated with lower churn rates
(16.70% and 15.35% respectively).

Add-on Services: Customers who have not subscribed to value-added services such as Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection, and Tech Support
are more likely to churn. This suggests that these services play a crucial role in enhancing customer loyalty and perceived value.

Demographics: The analysis also revealed that while senior citizens make up a smaller portion of the total customer base (16.21%), their churn rate is
proportionally higher than that of non-senior citizens.

Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to mitigate customer churn:

Incentivize Long-Term Contracts: Offer promotions such as discounted rates or free add-on services to encourage month-to-month customers, especially those
with Fiber Optic service, to switch to one- or two-year contracts.

Enhance Onboarding for New Customers: Implement a dedicated retention strategy for new customers in their first few months. This could include personalized
welcome messages, proactive check-ins, and special introductory offers to solidify their commitment.

Promote Automated Payment Options: Encourage customers to switch from electronic checks to automated payment methods by offering incentives like a small discount
or a sign-up bonus.

Upsell Add-on Services: Actively market the benefits of add-on services like Online Security and Tech Support, particularly to new and high-risk customers,
to increase perceived value and build long-term loyalty.

Develop Targeted Offers for Senior Citizens: Create and market specific plans or services that cater to the unique needs of senior citizens to improve retention
within this demographic.

Technical Details
Data Source: The analysis is based on a Customer Churn.csv dataset.

Tools and Libraries: The project uses Python with the following libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib for data visualization.

numpy for numerical operations.

Code: The analysis is documented in a Jupyter Notebook (Customer Churn Analysis.ipynb), which includes the code for data loading, cleaning, and visualization.
The notebook demonstrates data-driven storytelling and the ability to translate insights into strategic business recommendations.
